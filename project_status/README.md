| Testing on gRPC in a single machine | A basic gRPC application is deployed in gRPC server and a client will access this service. | [gRPC](http://github.com/wkarny/grpc-java) | Completed |
| Analysis of throughtput of gRPC with default protobuf | A basic key value store application is deployed in gRPC server and a client will access this service repeatedly from the same machine through more than one thread. In this we are also evaluating throughput for the gRPC server | [gRPC](http://github.com/wkarny/grpc-java) | Completed |
| Analysis of throughtput of gRPC JSON | 	| [gRPC](http://github.com/wkarny/kvstore) | Completed |
